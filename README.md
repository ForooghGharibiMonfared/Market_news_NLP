# Market_news_NLP
In this Project we use <b> Daily news</b> to design a <b> NLP </b> algorithm for <b> Stock Market Prediction</b>. At first we had 49 percent accuracy but with some methodes like using pretrained English word Vector and attempt with convolutions and bidirectional lstmlayers we could improve it to 52 percent accuracy.
